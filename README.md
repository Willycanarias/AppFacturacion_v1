# Project Title

Invoice application with IONIC + EXPRESS + SEQUELIZE + MYSQL

## Getting Started

This application works to give the user the option to register, list, modify and delete invoices.
Firstly, the data you can insert, view, modify and delete is compound by ID's company and name's entity. 

The application is opened for further developments, where you will be able to deal with more information, like date of the invoice, descriptions, price before taxes, the quantity of the tax applied and the total price of the invoice.

### Prerequisites

Requirements for the software and other tools to build, test and push 
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### Installing

To run the application, you have to get into the backend directory with the next command: "cd backend".
Once you have done so, the next command to use is: "node index.js".

Secondly, comeback to the root folder: "cd ..".
After it, get in the frontend: "cd frontend".
Lastly, write: "ionic serve" to run the program.

With this, you are going to be able to use the application properly with the features available (list and insert) and watch-interact with the interfaces as well.

To see how it works, push the button to open the menu.

Click on the list-button to list the invoices, to see the invoices registered in the database.

If you want to insert a new one, click on the insert-button to insert it.

There, you have to write data for both inputs. Once you do it, click to send the data to the database, and the app will inmediatly show you that's been written correctly (it will send you to the list page).
